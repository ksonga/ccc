<head id="B">CLIMATE CHANGE</head>
<br><br>
<p1>There are 46 countries, spanning from Afghanistan to Zambia, that are considered Least Developed Countries (LDCs). They are home to about 13 percent of the world’s population and 40 percent of its poorest people. They are highly vulnerable to countless shocks - from economic, public health to climate change. They remain at the forefront of the climate crisis and are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events. And unfortunately, they lack critical financing to support climate-resilient measures and infrastructure.  
On 25 January, LDC5 - a conference that happens every 10 years - will include a high-level thematic roundtable on climate change to discuss the unique and urgent issues that LDCs face and the necessary support that they need to ensure that much-needed economic growth does not take place at the expense of their already fragile ecosystems and diminishing natural resources.  </p1>

<p2>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which publishes assessments of climate science every six to seven years, will launch its first comprehensive assessment report since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. 
he IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) will encompass contributions from three working groups led by some of the world’s leading scientists on the physical understanding of the climate system and climate change [Working Group I - published in August 2021]; the impacts of climate change [Working Group II]; and the progress on mitigation and efforts to limit emissions [Working Group III].
